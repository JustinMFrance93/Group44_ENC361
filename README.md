ENCE361: Personal step counter project

Authors: Justin France and Willaim Fraser

 The goal of this project is to implement an embedded sysytem to record a userâ€™s steps and
 estimate the distance travelled by the user. The step counter will be powered by a STM32C071
 nucleo development board, connected to an expansion board. The project will involve developing
 firmware for the STM32C071 to record and display step data via a graphical user interface. Like
 professional embedded systems projects, this project will require both technical knowledge and
 interpersonal skills to complete successfully.

 Supplementary Code files used for this ENCE361 2025 Step Counter Project was produced by the
 University of Canterbury Staff C.Moore, P.Claude and F.Youssif.
